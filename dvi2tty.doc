       _d_v_i_2_t_t_y converts a TeX DVI-file to a format that is  appr-
       poriate  for  terminals  and  lineprinters. The program is
       intended to be used for preliminary proofreading of TeX-ed
       documents.   By default the output is directed to the ter-
       minal, possibly through a pager (depending on how the pro-
       gram was installed), but it can be directed to a file or a
       pipe.

       The output leaves much to be desired, but is still usefull
       if you want to avoid walking to the laserprinter (or what-
       ever) for each iteration of your document.
       Since _d_v_i_2_t_t_y produces output for terminals and lineprint-
       ers  the  representation  of  documents is naturally quite
       primitive.  Fontchanges are totally ignored, which implies
       that  special  symbols,  such as mathematical symbols, get
       mapped into the characters at the corresponding  positions
       in the "standard" fonts.

       If the width of the output text requires more columns than
       fits in one line (c.f. the -w option) it  is  broken  into
       several  lines by _d_v_i_2_t_t_y although they will be printed as
       one    line    on    regular    TeX     output     devices
       (e.g.laserprinters).  To show that a broken line is really
       just one logical line an  asterisk  (``*'')  in  the  last
       position  means  that the logical line is continued on the
       next physical line output by _d_v_i_2_t_t_y_.  Such a continuation
       line  is  started  with  a  a space and an asterisk in the
       first two columns.

       Options may  be  specified  in  the  environment  variable
       DVI2TTY.   Any option on the commandline, conflicting with
       one in the environment, will override  the  one  from  the
       environment.

       --oo ffiillee
              Write output to file ``file''.

       --pp lliisstt
              Print  the  pages chosen by list.  Numbers refer to
              TeX-page numbers (known as \count0).  An example of
              format for list is ``1,3:6,8'' to choose pages 1, 3
              through 6 and 8.   Negative  numbers  can  be  used
              exactly  as  in  TeX,  e g -1 comes before -4 as in
              ``-p-1:-4,17''.

       --PP lliisstt
              Like -p except  that  page  numbers  refer  to  the
              sequential  ordering  of the pages in the dvi-file.
              Negative numbers don't make a lot of sense  here...

       --ww nn   Specify  terminal  width  _n_.   Legal  range 16-132.
              Default is 80. If your terminal has the ability  to
              display  in  132 columns it might be a good idea to
              use -w132 and toggle the terminal into this mode as
              output will probably look somewhat better.

       --qq     Don't pipe the output through a pager.  This may be
              the default on some systems (depending on the whims
              of the SA installing the program).

       --ff     Pipe  through  a pager, $PAGER if defined, or what-
              ever your SA compiled in (often ``more''). This may
              be  the  default,  but it is still okay to redirect
              output with ``>'', the pager will not  be  used  if
              output is not going to a terminal.

       --FF     Specify   the  pager  program  to  be  used.   This
              overides the $PAGER and the default pager.

       --FFpprroogg Use ``prog'' as program to pipe output into. Can be
              used to choose an alternate pager (e g ``-Fless'').

       --ll     Mark pagebreaks  with  the  two-character  sequence
              ``^L''. The default is to mark them with a formfeed
              character.

       --uu     Don't make any attempts to find  special  Scandina-
              vian  characters.   If  such  characters are in the
              text they will map to ``a''  and  ``o''.   This  is
              probably  the  default outside of Scandinavia. (The
              SA  made  the  decision  when   the   program   was
              installed.)

       --ss     Try  to  find  the  special Scandinavian characters
              that on most  (?)   terminals  in  Scandinavia  are
              mapped to ``{|}[\]''.  This can be the default, and
              output from  files  not  containing  these  special
              characters  will  be  identical  regardless of this
              option.

FFIILLEESS
       /usr/ucb/more      probably the default pager.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       PAGER              the pager to use.
       DVI2TTY               can  be  set  to  hold   commandline
       options.

       Blanks  between  words  get  lost quite easy. This is less
       likely if you are using a wider output  than  the  default
       80.

       Only one file may be specified on the commandline.
